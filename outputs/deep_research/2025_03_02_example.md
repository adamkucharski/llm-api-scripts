Understood! I will collect data on post-vaccination immune responses against the XBB 1.5 SARS-CoV-2 variant, focusing on neutralizing antibody kinetics over time from studies published in 2022 onwards. The dataset will include:

- Neutralizing antibody titers (e.g., IC50, IC80) where available
- Only mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna)
- Covariates including age and prior infection status (if reported)
- Standardized time points where possible
- Missing values marked as NA for consistency

I will generate machine-readable CSV files with raw antibody measurements, along with visualizations of antibody kinetics over time. I’ll get back to you once the data is compiled and analyzed.

# Post-Vaccination Neutralizing Antibody Kinetics Against XBB.1.5

## Overview 
The Omicron XBB.1.5 subvariant has shown significant immune-evasive properties, reducing the efficacy of antibodies from prior vaccination or infection ([

To counter this, updated **mRNA vaccines** (Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA-1273 variants) targeting XBB-lineage spikes were introduced in late 2022–2023. We summarize data from studies (2022 onward) examining **neutralizing antibody kinetics** against XBB.1.5 after mRNA vaccination. We focus on neutralizing titer measurements (typically **50% inhibitory dilution titers, ID<sub>50</sub> or FRNT<sub>50</sub>**) at standardized time points, stratified by **prior infection status** and age where available. Missing values are marked as “NA.” 

## Neutralizing Antibody Response Kinetics 
**Early post-booster rise and peak:** Both monovalent XBB.1.5-specific boosters and earlier bivalent boosters elicit a rapid rise in neutralizing antibodies within 2–4 weeks. For example, in a cohort of 55 healthcare workers (mean age ~53) given a Moderna XBB.1.5 booster, the **geometric mean neutralizing titer** against XBB.1.5 increased from a **pre-booster GMT of ~114** to **~838 by 3 weeks post-vaccination** (a ~7.4-fold rise) ([

Another study of 40 adults in Korea (median age 36) receiving a BA.5-bivalent mRNA booster showed **XBB.1.5 neutralization GMT rising from ~55 pre-booster to ~227 at 1 month**, then peaking and beginning to wane ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10767551/#:~:text=XBB.1.5%20Pre,9)). Individuals with **prior Omicron infection** had significantly higher titers at all time points (e.g. ~63→307 at 1 month) compared to infection-naïve individuals (~39→95 at 1 month) ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10767551/#:~:text=XBB.1.5%20Pre,9)), although fold-increases were high in both groups. These data confirm that XBB.1.5-targeted boosters can substantially raise antibody levels even when baseline neutralization of XBB.1.5 is low ([

**Waning over time:** After the initial peak, neutralizing antibody levels against XBB.1.5 **decline gradually** over subsequent months, though kinetics vary by vaccine type. In the Korean BA.5-bivalent booster cohort, **titers fell by ~25% from 1 to 3 months** post-booster (GMT ~227 at 1 mo to ~172 at 3 mo in the overall group) ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10767551/#:~:text=XBB.1.5%20Pre,9)). Notably, infection-naïve individuals experienced a slightly sharper relative drop (from 95 to 71) than previously infected individuals (307 to 226) ([

However, the newer XBB.1.5-specific boosters appear to **maintain titers longer** than earlier formulations.

By 6 months, XBB.1.5 booster recipients showed a slower decay of neutralization (slopes ~–0.001 to –0.002 log/day) compared to BA.5-booster recipients whose titers waned faster ([

**Covariate effects:** Prior infection (especially with Omicron) boosts absolute neutralizing titers post-vaccination. In one analysis, subjects with prior Omicron infection who received an XBB.1.5 booster reached **ID<sub>50</sub> titers 1,504–22,978** against various XBB subvariants, significantly higher than those in infection-naïve vaccinees ([

Age can also influence responses: older adults tend to have lower neutralization magnitudes and possibly faster waning. Many studies stratify elderly groups (e.g. ≥65) and find slightly reduced peak titers, though still substantial boosts after XBB-containing vaccines (often reported separately in regulatory assessments). In our compiled dataset below, we include age (when provided) and prior infection status as covariates for each observation.

## Compiled Dataset 
We aggregated neutralizing antibody titer data from representative studies (published 2022–2024) that reported **XBB.1.5-specific neutralization** at multiple time points after mRNA vaccination. All titers are 50% neutralization dilutions (ID<sub>50</sub> or equivalent) reported as geometric mean titers (GMT). “Time” is given in days post-vaccination (0 = pre-vaccine baseline). “Biomarker” denotes the assay/target (here all are neutralizing antibody titers against XBB.1.5). **Prior infection** indicates if participants had documented SARS-CoV-2 infection before vaccination. **Age** is given in years (mean or median as reported). Missing data are denoted “NA.”

Neutralizing titers against XBB.1.5 were measured by live-virus microneutralization at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months post-vaccination, stratified by prior infection status (29 had prior COVID-19, mostly Omicron; 11 were infection-naïve) ([

Key observations from this study: At 1 month post-booster, **GMT ~307** (previously infected) vs **~95** (naïve) – a **3.2-fold difference** favoring those with prior infection ([

The **fold-rise** from baseline in naïve individuals was larger (≈2.4× at 1 mo) than in previously infected (~4.8×), reflecting their lower starting point ([

Neutralization against XBB.1.5 was measured by FRNT<sub>50</sub> (live-virus focus reduction neutralization) at baseline and ~21 days post-vaccine.

## Visualization of Antibody Kinetics 
To effectively illustrate these trends, we can plot neutralizing antibody levels over time after vaccination. Below we present two complementary visualizations: (1) **Short-term rise** in XBB.1.5-neutralizing titers from pre- to post-booster, and (2) **Longer-term persistence** (waning) of those titers over months.

- **Short-term boost (Pre vs Post):** The embedded chart (from Tafesse et al. ([

The XBB.1.5 panel highlights a dramatic increase in neutralization by 21 days post-vaccine (most blue points are far above the corresponding gray points), with a median **7.4× rise** ([

This kind of plot (before-and-after with individual trajectories) emphasizes that **nearly all participants responded** with higher antibody levels, even if starting from minimal immunity. 

- **Long-term waning:** To visualize durability, line plots or decay curves are useful. For example, Wang *et al.* compared neutralizing titers at ~1, ~3, and ~6 months in people who received an XBB.1.5 booster vs those with a BA.5 bivalent booster ([

Panel E shows the average **slope of titer change per day** between 3 and 6 months: for XBB.1.5, the slope is near-zero (no significant decay), significantly flatter than for the BA.5 booster ([

In the above multi-panel chart, focus on the **XBB.1.5 plots**: after an XBB.1.5 booster (brown lines, panel D), titers remain high and mostly horizontal through month 6, whereas after a BA.5 booster (orange lines), titers show a downward trend. Quantitatively, the **median decay rate was ~0** for XBB.1.5-elicited antibodies versus a modest negative slope for BA.5-booster antibodies (panel E) ([

These visualizations reinforce the quantitative data: **XBB.1.5-targeted boosters not only raise antibodies to higher levels, but also maintain those levels for longer**, compared to earlier mRNA vaccines ([

## Conclusion 
From 2022 onwards, studies consistently show that **mRNA boosters induce strong neutralizing antibody responses against XBB.1.5**, with peak titers achieved ~1 month post-vaccination. Prior infection and younger age correlate with higher absolute titers, but all groups experience substantial boosts. **Neutralizing antibodies then wane over time**, but the **kinetics depend on the vaccine strain match**. Boosters updated to XBB.1.5 confer more durable neutralization of XBB-lineage variants, with slower decay over 3–6 months ([
