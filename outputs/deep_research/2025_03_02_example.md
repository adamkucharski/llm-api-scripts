Understood! I will collect raw measurement data on neutralizing antibody kinetics against the JN.1 SARS-CoV-2 variant following mRNA vaccination. The dataset will include standardized columns for 'time' (in days post-vaccination), 'biomarker' (e.g., neutralizing antibody titer), and 'value', along with key covariates like 'age' and 'prior infection' where available. Missing values will be marked as 'NA'. I will also generate effective visualizations of the data. I'll update you once the data is compiled and analyzed.

# Neutralizing Antibody Kinetics Against SARS-CoV-2 JN.1 Variant (Post-2023 Vaccination Studies)

## Compiled Dataset of Neutralizing Antibody Titers (JN.1 Variant)

The table below collates raw neutralizing antibody measurements against the JN.1 SARS-CoV-2 variant from multiple studies (2023–2024) of post-vaccination immune responses. Data are presented with standardized columns for time (days post-vaccination), the immune **biomarker** (neutralizing antibody titer, as geometric mean titer – GMT), the **value** of that measurement, participant **age** (or age group), **prior infection** status, and vaccine/booster type. Missing or not reported values are marked as “NA.”

## Antibody Kinetics Over Time by Age and Prior Infection Status

The figures below visualize neutralizing antibody kinetics against JN.1 over time, stratified by age and prior infection where applicable. “Kinetics” here refers to the rise in neutralizing titer from baseline (pre-boost) to a post-vaccination time-point, as reported in each study.

 ([Immunogenicity of the Monovalent Omicron XBB.1.5-Adapted BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccine against XBB.1.5, BA.2.86, and JN.1 Sublineages: A Phase 2/3 Trial](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/12/7/734)) *Neutralizing antibody titers against the JN.1 variant measured before (Pre) and 1 month after (1m) booster vaccination with either a monovalent XBB.1.5 mRNA vaccine or a BA.4/BA.5 bivalent vaccine, stratified by age group (younger: 18–55 y vs. older: >55 y) ([Immunogenicity of the Monovalent Omicron XBB.1.5-Adapted BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccine against XBB.1.5, BA.2.86, and JN.1 Sublineages: A Phase 2/3 Trial](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/12/7/734#:~:text=Figure%201.%20SARS,test%3B%20Pre%20%3D%20before%20vaccination)). Bars show the 50% neutralization GMT on a log₁₀ scale (with 95% CI). Numeric labels indicate GMT values, and brackets denote the geometric mean fold-rise from baseline. In this study, the XBB.1.5 booster induced higher post-vaccination titers against JN.1 than the older bivalent booster, especially in older adults ([Immunogenicity of the Monovalent Omicron XBB.1.5-Adapted BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccine against XBB.1.5, BA.2.86, and JN.1 Sublineages: A Phase 2/3 Trial](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/12/7/734#:~:text=monovalent%20XBB.1.5,gov%20Identifier%3A%20NCT05997290)) ([Immunogenicity of the Monovalent Omicron XBB.1.5-Adapted BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccine against XBB.1.5, BA.2.86, and JN.1 Sublineages: A Phase 2/3 Trial](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/12/7/734#:~:text=participants%20in%20the%20older%20group,207%E2%80%93543)).*

As shown above, individuals boosted with an **XBB.1.5-adapted vaccine** (left, yellow bars) had substantially higher neutralizing titers against JN.1 by 1 month post-vaccination compared to baseline ([Immunogenicity of the Monovalent Omicron XBB.1.5-Adapted BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccine against XBB.1.5, BA.2.86, and JN.1 Sublineages: A Phase 2/3 Trial](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/12/7/734#:~:text=monovalent%20XBB.1.5,gov%20Identifier%3A%20NCT05997290)). By contrast, those who received the prior **BA.4/BA.5 bivalent booster** (right, orange bars) had lower absolute titers against JN.1 ([Immunogenicity of the Monovalent Omicron XBB.1.5-Adapted BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccine against XBB.1.5, BA.2.86, and JN.1 Sublineages: A Phase 2/3 Trial](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/12/7/734#:~:text=monovalent%20XBB.1.5,gov%20Identifier%3A%20NCT05997290)). Notably, older adults (>55 years) achieved higher GMTs than younger adults in both cases (e.g. compare red vs. blue bars) ([Immunogenicity of the Monovalent Omicron XBB.1.5-Adapted BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccine against XBB.1.5, BA.2.86, and JN.1 Sublineages: A Phase 2/3 Trial](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/12/7/734#:~:text=match%20at%20L776%20participants%20in,207%E2%80%93543)). For example, the older group reached a Jn.1 titer of 347 one month after the XBB.1.5 booster, versus 207 in the younger group (see yellow/red vs. blue bars) – despite similar baseline levels – indicating age can influence the magnitude of the antibody response ([Immunogenicity of the Monovalent Omicron XBB.1.5-Adapted BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccine against XBB.1.5, BA.2.86, and JN.1 Sublineages: A Phase 2/3 Trial](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/12/7/734#:~:text=match%20at%20L776%20participants%20in,207%E2%80%93543)). Nevertheless, both age groups showed a clear increase from pre- to post-vaccination titers, illustrating robust **boosting of neutralizing antibodies** against JN.1 after updated vaccination.

The above graphic (from Wang *et al*.) highlights the impact of **prior infection** on antibody kinetics. In **infection-naïve individuals** (left panel), an XBB.1.5 booster raised JN.1-neutralizing titers by ~13-fold (from near the detection limit up to robust levels) ([

Importantly, the previously infected cohort still achieved higher absolute antibody levels post-booster (red bars) compared to infection-naïve individuals ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10948033/#:~:text=,9%20fold)), but their incremental rise was muted because their pre-existing immunity was already elevated. These findings demonstrate that prior infection provides a head start (higher starting titer) but also dampens the relative boosting effect of vaccination, whereas infection-naïve individuals see a dramatic fold-rise from a low baseline ([

## Key Observations and Conclusions

- **Magnitude of JN.1 Neutralization:** Across studies, the JN.1 variant consistently showed **reduced neutralization** compared to earlier strains. Post-vaccination sera had significantly lower titers against JN.1 than against the vaccine-matched XBB.1.5 strain (typically by a factor of 2–5 fold) ([

- **Impact of Updated Boosters:** Despite its immune evasiveness, JN.1 can be effectively neutralized after updated boosters. **Monovalent XBB.1.5 mRNA vaccines** induced a strong rise in antibodies against JN.1 – often an order of magnitude increase from baseline. Small clinical series (including preprints) observed **>10-fold boosts** in JN.1-neutralizing titers after XBB.1.5 vaccination ([Will COVID Vaccines Continue to Work Against JN.1 and Other New Variants?](https://www.idsociety.org/covid-19-real-time-learning-network/vaccines/will-covid-vaccines-continue-to-work-against-jn.1-and-other-new-variants#:~:text=monovalent%20XBB,reviewed)). In the Pfizer trial, the XBB.1.5 booster raised JN.1 GMT by ~3.9-fold (vs. ~3.5-fold for the older bivalent booster) despite all participants having prior immunity ([Immunogenicity of the Monovalent Omicron XBB.1.5-Adapted BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccine against XBB.1.5, BA.2.86, and JN.1 Sublineages: A Phase 2/3 Trial](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/12/7/734#:~:text=monovalent%20XBB.1.5,gov%20Identifier%3A%20NCT05997290)). In individuals without prior infection, the fold-increase was even higher (≈13-fold) ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10948033/#:~:text=Wang%20et%C2%A0al,recommendations%20for%20its%20widespread%20use)). These data underscore that updated boosters significantly enhance neutralizing antibody levels against JN.1.

- **Age as a Covariate:** Age stratification suggests older adults tend to have **higher neutralizing titers** after vaccination than younger adults ([Immunogenicity of the Monovalent Omicron XBB.1.5-Adapted BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccine against XBB.1.5, BA.2.86, and JN.1 Sublineages: A Phase 2/3 Trial](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/12/7/734#:~:text=participants%20in%20the%20older%20group,207%E2%80%93543)). In the XBB.1.5 booster trial, participants >55 years had higher post-vaccination GMTs to JN.1 than those 18–55 years (e.g. 347 vs 207) ([Immunogenicity of the Monovalent Omicron XBB.1.5-Adapted BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccine against XBB.1.5, BA.2.86, and JN.1 Sublineages: A Phase 2/3 Trial](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/12/7/734#:~:text=match%20at%20L776%20participants%20in,207%E2%80%93543)), even though fold-rises were similar. This could reflect more robust recall responses in older individuals primed by longer vaccination histories or differences in immune system priming. Regardless, both age groups showed substantial antibody increases (no evidence of an age-related failure to respond).

- **Prior Infection as a Covariate:** Prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 (especially with antigenically distinct Omicron strains) provided a **higher baseline** of neutralizing antibodies but a **lower relative boost** upon vaccination. Cohorts with previous Omicron infection had detectable JN.1-neutralizing activity even before boosting (baseline ID<sub>50</sub> titers on the order of 10^2–10^3) and experienced modest titer rises (e.g. ~4–6 fold) after an XBB.1.5 booster ([

In contrast, those without prior infection started at or near seronegative baseline and saw much larger fold increases (often >10-fold) ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10948033/#:~:text=XBB,Notably%2C%20the%20increase%20in)). Ultimately, **post-booster titers** reached high levels in both groups (e.g. geometric mean >10^3) ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10948033/#:~:text=,9%20fold)), indicating that prior infection mainly affects the *kinetics* (fold-change) but not the ability to achieve strong neutralization after boosting.

- **Neutralization vs. Variants:** Neutralizing antibody kinetics against JN.1 need to be viewed in context of other variants. Studies showed that titers against JN.1 were the **lowest among contemporaneous variants** tested ([

In practical terms, while JN.1 can significantly evade antibodies, current vaccines still induce cross-neutralizing activity against it – just at reduced titers relative to other variants.

In summary, data from recent studies (since 2023) indicate that the Omicron JN.1 variant substantially escapes neutralizing antibodies, but **post-vaccination responses can be boosted to effective levels**. Updated XBB.1.5-targeted vaccines lead to robust increases in neutralizing antibody titers against JN.1, especially in individuals without prior exposure ([Will COVID Vaccines Continue to Work Against JN.1 and Other New Variants?](https://www.idsociety.org/covid-19-real-time-learning-network/vaccines/will-covid-vaccines-continue-to-work-against-jn.1-and-other-new-variants#:~:text=monovalent%20XBB,reviewed)) ([

Key factors such as age and infection history modulate the kinetics: older and previously infected individuals tend to have higher starting titers and achieve high absolute antibody levels, though the **fold-rise** in those with prior immunity is less dramatic ([

Overall, these findings reinforce the importance of variant-updated booster vaccines, which **significantly broaden neutralizing antibody responses** to emergent strains like JN.1 ([
