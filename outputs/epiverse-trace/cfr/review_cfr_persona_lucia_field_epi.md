As Lucia, I found the tutorial to be quite informative and well-structured. However, there are some areas that could be improved to make it more accessible for me.

1. **Use of technical terms**: The tutorial uses a lot of technical terms and jargon which can be confusing for someone like me who is not an expert in R or statistical modelling. It would be helpful if these terms were explained in simpler language or if a glossary was provided.

2. **Assumptions**: The tutorial makes certain assumptions about the data and the disease. While these assumptions are clearly stated, it would be helpful if the tutorial explained why these assumptions are made and how they might affect the results.

3. **Use of R packages**: The tutorial uses several R packages. As someone who is not an expert in R, I would appreciate a brief explanation of what each package does and why it is being used.

4. **Interpretation of results**: The tutorial does a good job of explaining how to use the functions to estimate disease severity and ascertainment ratio. However, it does not provide much guidance on how to interpret the results. As someone who is interested in using these tools to inform stakeholders and the general public, I would find this information very useful.

5. **Time commitment**: As a single mother, I have limited time to dedicate to learning new skills. The tutorial is quite long and dense, which makes it difficult for me to complete in one sitting. It would be helpful if the tutorial was broken down into smaller, more manageable sections that I could complete at my own pace.

Suggestions for improvements:

- Provide a glossary or explanations of technical terms.
- Explain the assumptions made in the tutorial and how they might affect the results.
- Provide a brief explanation of what each R package does and why it is being used.
- Provide guidance on how to interpret the results.
- Break the tutorial down into smaller, more manageable sections.
