The vignette is well-structured and provides a clear step-by-step guide on how to estimate disease severity while correcting for reporting delays. However, as Lucia, I have a few concerns and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Use of R packages**: The vignette uses several R packages such as `cfr`, `covidregionaldata`, and `outbreaks`. While I am familiar with some R packages like `{tidyverse}`, `{ggplot2}`, and `{rmarkdown}`, these are new to me. It would be helpful to have a brief introduction or explanation about what these packages do and why they are necessary for the analysis.

2. **Statistical concepts**: The vignette assumes a certain level of understanding of statistical concepts such as the Gamma distribution, ascertainment ratio, and case fatality risk (CFR). As a field epidemiologist, I have a basic understanding of these concepts but a refresher or more detailed explanation would be beneficial. 

3. **Interpretation of outputs**: The vignette provides the code to generate the outputs but lacks a detailed interpretation of these outputs. As someone who wants to learn how to interpret the statistical and mathematical outputs generated by infectious disease modelling R packages, I would appreciate more guidance on this.

4. **Time constraints**: As a single mother with limited time, I would appreciate if the vignette could be broken down into smaller, manageable sections. This would allow me to learn at my own pace and not feel overwhelmed by the amount of information.

5. **Case-studies per disease type**: The vignette uses data from the Ebola outbreak as an example. It would be helpful to have more case-studies per disease type to understand how to apply the concepts to different scenarios.

6. **Assumptions**: The vignette makes certain assumptions such as the distribution of delays from past outbreaks being informative about reporting delays in the current outbreak. It would be helpful to have a discussion on the implications of these assumptions and how they might affect the analysis.

In summary, the vignette is a good starting point but could benefit from more detailed explanations of the concepts, interpretation of the outputs, and more case-studies. It should also consider the time constraints of the users and break down the content into smaller sections.
