As Patricia, I find this tutorial quite informative and useful. It provides a clear explanation of the concept of disease severity and the case fatality risk (CFR), and how reporting delays can affect the estimation of these parameters. The use of real-world examples, such as the Ebola outbreak, makes the tutorial more relatable and easier to understand. 

However, there are a few areas that could be improved:

- The tutorial assumes that I am familiar with certain concepts and terminologies such as "Gamma distribution", "shape", "scale", and "ascertainment ratio". As a learner, I would appreciate a brief explanation or reference to these terms for better understanding.

- The tutorial uses R code to demonstrate the concepts, which is great since I am learning R. However, it does not explain what each line of code does. As a beginner in R, I would appreciate some comments in the code explaining what each line does.

- The tutorial mentions several R packages such as _cfr_, _covidregionaldata_, and _outbreaks_, but does not explain what these packages do or why they are needed. It would be helpful to provide a brief description of these packages and how they are used in the tutorial.

- The tutorial could be improved by providing more guidance on how to interpret the output of the R functions used. For example, what does the output of the `cfr_static()` function tell us about the disease severity?

- The tutorial could also include some exercises or practice problems for me to apply what I have learned. This would help reinforce the concepts and improve my understanding.

- Lastly, the tutorial could provide some additional resources for further learning, such as books, online courses, or tutorials on disease epidemiology or R programming.
