- The vignette is well-structured and provides a clear explanation of the problem it aims to solve. However, as a beginner in R and someone who is not familiar with the terminal window, the use of R code without sufficient explanation can be confusing. For example, the use of the `cfr_static()` function is not explained in detail. It would be helpful to have a brief explanation of what each argument in the function does.

- The use of the `knitr::opts_chunk$set()` function is not explained. As a beginner, I would appreciate a brief explanation of what this function does and why it is necessary.

- The use of the `dgamma()` function in the `delay_density` argument of the `cfr_static()` function is not explained. It would be helpful to have a brief explanation of what this function does and why it is used here.

- The vignette does a good job of explaining the concept of reporting delays and how they can bias CFR estimates. This is very useful for someone like me who is studying infectious disease epidemiology.

- The vignette could be improved by providing more context about the data used in the examples. For example, it would be helpful to know more about the Ebola outbreak data used in the examples, such as where it came from and how it was collected.

- The vignette could also be improved by providing more information about the packages used, such as `cfr`, `covidregionaldata`, and `outbreaks`. As a beginner, I would appreciate a brief explanation of what these packages do and why they are necessary for the analysis.

- The use of alerts to highlight important information is very helpful. However, it would be even more helpful if these alerts were used to highlight important steps in the code or to provide tips for beginners.

- The vignette could be improved by providing more examples of how to use the functions in the `cfr` package. For example, it would be helpful to see examples of how to use the `cfr_time_varying()` and `estimate_ascertainment()` functions with different types of data.

- The vignette could also be improved by providing more information about how to interpret the results of the analysis. For example, it would be helpful to know what a high or low ascertainment ratio means in the context of an outbreak.
