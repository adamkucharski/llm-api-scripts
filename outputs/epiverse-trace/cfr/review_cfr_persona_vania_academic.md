As Vania, I find this tutorial very useful and relevant to my work. It provides a clear explanation of how to estimate disease severity while correcting for reporting delays, which is a crucial aspect of my research. However, there are a few areas that could be improved to make the tutorial more accessible and easier to understand for someone like me who is not very familiar with programming.

1. **Jargon and technical terms**: The tutorial uses a lot of technical terms and jargon that are not explained. For example, terms like "Gamma distributed", "onset-to-death distribution", "ascertainment ratio", and "naive estimator" are used without any explanation. This could be confusing for someone who is not familiar with these terms. I suggest adding a glossary or explanations for these terms to make the tutorial more accessible.

2. **Assumptions**: The tutorial mentions some assumptions, such as the data on reporting delays from past outbreaks being informative about reporting delays in the current outbreak. However, it does not explain why these assumptions are made or how they might affect the results. I would appreciate more information on this.

3. **Code explanation**: The tutorial provides code snippets but does not explain what each line of code does. As someone who is not very familiar with R, I would find it helpful if the tutorial provided more detailed explanations of the code.

4. **Use of packages**: The tutorial uses several packages, such as the _cfr_ package and the _epiparameter_ package. However, it does not explain what these packages do or why they are necessary. I would appreciate more information on this.

5. **Practical examples**: The tutorial provides a use case and some examples, but I would find it helpful if there were more practical examples that I could apply to my own research.

In summary, I find this tutorial very useful and relevant, but it could be improved by providing more explanations of technical terms and code, discussing the assumptions made, explaining the use of packages, and providing more practical examples.
