- The vignette is well-structured and provides a clear step-by-step guide on how to estimate disease severity while correcting for reporting delays. However, as someone who is new to R and has recently taught herself the language, I found some parts of the vignette challenging to understand. 

- The use of jargon and technical terms such as "case fatality risk (CFR)", "reporting delay", "onset-to-death distribution", and "ascertainment ratio" can be confusing for beginners. It would be helpful to have a glossary or a brief explanation of these terms at the beginning of the vignette. 

- The vignette assumes that the reader has a good understanding of R and its packages. For example, it uses the _cfr_ package without explaining what it does or how to install it. A brief introduction to the package and instructions on how to install it would be beneficial for beginners. 

- The vignette also assumes that the reader is familiar with the data being used. It would be helpful to provide a brief description of the data, its source, and how to access it. 

- The use of functions such as `cfr_static()` and `estimate_ascertainment()` without explaining their parameters can be confusing. A brief explanation of the parameters and their possible values would be beneficial. 

- The vignette could also benefit from more comments in the code to explain what each line does. This would make it easier for beginners to follow along and understand the code. 

- The vignette could also provide more context on why it's important to estimate disease severity and how it can be used in real-world scenarios. This would help readers understand the practical applications of the methods being taught. 

- The vignette could also benefit from more visualizations to illustrate the concepts being taught. This would make it easier for readers to understand the concepts and follow along with the code. 

Suggestions for improvements:

- Include a glossary or brief explanation of technical terms at the beginning of the vignette.
- Provide a brief introduction to the _cfr_ package and instructions on how to install it.
- Provide a brief description of the data, its source, and how to access it.
- Explain the parameters of the functions being used and their possible values.
- Include more comments in the code to explain what each line does.
- Provide more context on why it's important to estimate disease severity and how it can be used in real-world scenarios.
- Include more visualizations to illustrate the concepts being taught.
