- The tutorial is generally clear and well-structured. However, as Lucia, I find the use of technical terms and statistical concepts a bit overwhelming. For instance, terms like "ascertainment ratio", "severity", "delay-adjusted severity", "distribution of delays" are used without clear definitions or explanations. This makes it difficult for me to understand the tutorial fully.

- The use of R packages like `{cfr}`, `{dplyr}`, `{tidyr}`, `{purrr}`, `{scales}`, `{forcats}`, and `{ggplot2}` is useful. I am familiar with `{tidyverse}`, `{ggplot2}`, and `{rmarkdown}` for data cleaning, plotting, and reporting. However, I am not familiar with `{cfr}` and `{purrr}`. A brief introduction or link to resources for these packages would be helpful.

- The tutorial is difficult because it assumes a high level of statistical knowledge and familiarity with R programming. As Lucia, I am not an excellent `R` user and I need more time than a webinar to learn how to use new outbreak analytics R packages.

- The tutorial could be refined by providing more explanations and definitions of technical terms and statistical concepts. It could also include more practical examples and case studies to help me understand how to apply the concepts in real-world situations.

Suggestions for specific improvements:

- Include a glossary of technical terms and statistical concepts used in the tutorial. This will help learners like Lucia who are not familiar with these terms.

- Provide more practical examples and case studies. This will help Lucia understand how to apply the concepts in real-world situations.

- Include links to resources for learning more about the R packages used in the tutorial. This will help Lucia improve her R programming skills.

- Break down the tutorial into smaller, manageable sections. This will make it easier for Lucia to learn at her own pace, given her limited time for learning outside of work.
