Review:

- The tutorial is well-structured and provides a clear step-by-step guide on how to estimate the proportion of cases that are ascertained during an outbreak. This is useful for Patricia as she is learning to work with R for data transformation and visualization.

- The use of alerts to highlight important information and warnings is helpful. However, the tutorial could benefit from a glossary or a brief explanation of some terms and concepts such as 'ascertainment', 'severity', 'cfr', etc. This could be particularly useful for Patricia as she is not familiar with these terms.

- The tutorial provides a clear explanation of the code and what each line does. This is useful for Patricia as she is learning to code in R and needs to understand how the code works.

- The tutorial could benefit from more detailed explanations of the mathematical concepts and calculations involved in estimating the ascertainment. This could be particularly useful for Patricia as she has a background in Epidemiology and would likely appreciate a deeper understanding of the underlying principles.

- The tutorial could also benefit from more detailed explanations of the results and what they mean. This could be particularly useful for Patricia as she is learning to interpret and analyze data.

Suggestions for improvements:

- Include a glossary or a brief explanation of key terms and concepts.

- Provide more detailed explanations of the mathematical concepts and calculations involved in estimating the ascertainment.

- Provide more detailed explanations of the results and what they mean.

- Include more visual aids such as diagrams or flowcharts to help explain the process and the results.

- Include more examples and exercises for the learner to practice what they have learned.
