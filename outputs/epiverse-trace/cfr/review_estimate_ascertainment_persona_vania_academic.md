As Vania, I find the tutorial generally useful but there are several areas that could be improved to make it more accessible and easier to follow:

1. **Jargon and Terminology**: The tutorial uses a lot of technical terms and jargon without providing clear definitions or explanations. For example, terms like "ascertainment", "severity", "delay-adjusted severity", "CFR" are used without clear definitions. This could be confusing for someone who is not familiar with these terms. A glossary or links to resources for understanding these terms would be helpful.

2. **Assumptions and Limitations**: The tutorial does a good job of pointing out the assumptions and limitations of the methods used, such as the use of a continuous distribution instead of a discrete one, and the potential bias in the ascertainment ratio due to differences in case definitions. However, these are presented in a somewhat scattered manner throughout the tutorial. It would be helpful to have a dedicated section discussing the assumptions and limitations in a more systematic way.

3. **Code Explanation**: The tutorial provides R code for the analysis but does not explain the code in detail. For someone like me who is still learning R, it would be helpful to have more detailed explanations of what each line of code is doing.

4. **Data Source and Preparation**: The tutorial does not provide information on where the data comes from or how it was prepared. It would be helpful to have a section discussing the data source and any preprocessing steps that were taken.

5. **Visualizations**: While the tutorial does not include visualizations in the Rmd, it would be helpful to have visualizations to illustrate the results of the analysis. 

Suggestions for improvements:

- Include a glossary or links to resources for understanding technical terms and jargon.
- Have a dedicated section discussing the assumptions and limitations of the methods used.
- Provide more detailed explanations of the R code.
- Include a section discussing the data source and any preprocessing steps.
- Include visualizations to illustrate the results of the analysis.
