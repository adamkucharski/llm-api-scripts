**Review:**

The tutorial is well-structured and provides a step-by-step guide on how to calculate a static, delay-adjusted estimate of disease severity. It includes clear explanations of the concepts and functions used, as well as practical examples using real-world data. However, there are areas that could be improved to make it more accessible and useful for Lucia.

**Suggestions for improvements:**

1. **Clarify technical terms and concepts:** The tutorial uses several technical terms and concepts that may not be familiar to Lucia, such as "static estimate of the severity of an outbreak", "case fatality risk (CFR)", "delay density function", and "maximum-likelihood methods". Providing definitions or explanations of these terms in simpler language would make the tutorial more accessible.

2. **Provide more context for the code:** While the tutorial does a good job of explaining what each line of code does, it could provide more context for why certain functions or packages are used. For example, why is the `cfr_static()` function used to calculate the CFR? What does the `estimate_outcomes()` function do, and why is it necessary?

3. **Include more practical examples:** The tutorial includes two examples, one using data from the 1976 Ebola outbreak and another using data from the COVID-19 pandemic. Including more examples, particularly ones relevant to Lucia's work in Paraguay, would make the tutorial more useful and relatable.

4. **Explain the mathematical formulas:** The tutorial includes several mathematical formulas, but does not explain what they mean or how they are used. Providing a step-by-step walkthrough of these formulas, perhaps using one of the examples, would help Lucia understand them better.

5. **Include a summary or conclusion:** The tutorial ends abruptly with the mathematical formulas. Including a summary or conclusion that recaps the main points and provides next steps or further resources would make the tutorial more complete.

6. **Include a section on interpreting the results:** The tutorial shows how to calculate the CFR, but does not provide guidance on how to interpret the results. Including a section on this would help Lucia apply what she has learned to her work.

7. **Provide refreshers on applied statistics and mathematics concepts:** As Lucia has mentioned in her needs, she would benefit from refreshers on applied statistics and mathematics concepts. These could be included as side notes or additional resources.

8. **Include case-studies per disease type:** Lucia has expressed a need for case-studies per disease type. Including these in the tutorial would help her translate her field experience into practice.
