As Patricia, a PhD student in Infectious Disease Epidemiology, I find this tutorial very useful for my research work. However, there are a few areas that could be improved to make it more accessible for learners like me.

1. **Unclear**: The tutorial assumes a certain level of familiarity with R and the specific packages used. As someone who is still learning R, I would appreciate a brief introduction to the packages and their functions. For example, what is the `cfr` package and what does it do? 

2. **Useful**: The step-by-step guide on how to calculate the naive and corrected CFR is very helpful. It provides a clear workflow that I can follow and apply to my own data.

3. **Difficult**: The mathematical formulas provided are a bit intimidating for me. While I understand the need for them, it would be helpful if there was a more detailed explanation of what each symbol represents and how they are used in the calculations.

4. **Refinement**: The tutorial could benefit from more explanations and comments within the code. For example, what does the `filter()` function do in the context of this analysis? What are we filtering for?

**Suggestions for improvements:**

- Include a brief introduction to the packages used in the tutorial. Explain what they do and why they are necessary for this analysis.
- Provide a more detailed explanation of the mathematical formulas used. This could be in the form of a glossary or a separate section dedicated to explaining each symbol and its role in the calculations.
- Include more comments within the code to explain what each line does. This will help learners like me understand the workflow better.
- Consider including a section on troubleshooting common errors. This would be very helpful for beginners who are still getting familiar with R.
- Include a conclusion summarizing what was learned in the tutorial and how it can be applied to other datasets. This will help reinforce the learning objectives and provide a clear takeaway for the learners.
