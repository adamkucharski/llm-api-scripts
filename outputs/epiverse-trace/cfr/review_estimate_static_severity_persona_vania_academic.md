As Vania, I find the tutorial very informative and relevant to my field of study. However, there are a few areas that could be improved to make it more accessible and easier to understand.

1. **Jargon and Terminology:** The tutorial uses a lot of technical terms and jargon without explaining them. For example, terms like "case fatality risk (CFR)", "Gamma distribution", "delay density function", etc. are used without any explanation. This could be confusing for someone who is not familiar with these terms. A glossary or brief explanation of these terms would be helpful.

2. **Code Explanation:** While the tutorial provides code snippets, it does not explain what each line of code does. This could make it difficult for someone who is not familiar with R to follow along. Adding comments to the code or providing a brief explanation of what each line does would be beneficial.

3. **Data Source:** The tutorial uses data from the 1976 Ebola outbreak and the Covid-19 pandemic, but it does not explain where this data comes from or how it was collected. Providing a link to the data source or explaining how the data was collected would add credibility to the tutorial and allow learners to explore the data on their own.

4. **Visualizations:** Although visualizations are not shown in the R markdown, it would be helpful to include some in the final tutorial. Visualizations can make complex data easier to understand and can help learners better understand the concepts being taught.

5. **Practical Application:** The tutorial does a good job of explaining how to calculate a static, delay-adjusted estimate of disease severity, but it does not provide any practical applications of this knowledge. Including a section on how this information can be used in the real world would make the tutorial more relevant and interesting.

6. **Additional Resources:** The tutorial could benefit from a list of additional resources for learners who want to learn more about the topic. This could include links to relevant research papers, online courses, or other tutorials.

In summary, the tutorial is informative and relevant, but could be improved by explaining jargon and code, providing data sources, including visualizations, discussing practical applications, and providing additional resources.
