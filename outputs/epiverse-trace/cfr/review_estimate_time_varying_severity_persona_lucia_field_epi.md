As Lucia, I found the tutorial to be quite comprehensive and detailed. However, there are a few areas that could be improved to make it more accessible for someone with my background and needs. 

1. **Use of jargon and technical terms**: The tutorial uses a lot of technical terms and jargon that might not be familiar to someone who is not an expert in R or statistics. For example, terms like "lognormal distribution", "maximum likelihood estimation", and "binomially distributed" are used without much explanation. This could be confusing for someone who is not familiar with these concepts. 

    - **Suggestion**: Provide brief explanations or links to resources where these concepts are explained in a simple and understandable manner. 

2. **Assumptions and prerequisites**: The tutorial assumes a certain level of familiarity with R and its packages. For example, it assumes that the user is familiar with packages like `{tidyverse}`, `{ggplot2}`, and `{rmarkdown}`. 

    - **Suggestion**: Clearly state the prerequisites at the beginning of the tutorial. Provide links to resources where beginners can learn about these packages.

3. **Complex code snippets**: Some of the code snippets are quite complex and might be difficult for a beginner to understand. For example, the code snippet where the `cfr_time_varying()` function is applied over nested data is quite complex.

    - **Suggestion**: Break down complex code snippets into smaller parts and explain each part in detail. 

4. **Lack of context**: The tutorial jumps straight into the technical details without providing much context about why we are doing what we are doing. 

    - **Suggestion**: Provide more context and explain why each step is necessary. This will help learners understand not just how to do something, but also why they are doing it.

5. **Lack of exercises**: The tutorial does not provide any exercises or opportunities for the learner to practice what they have learned.

    - **Suggestion**: Include exercises at the end of each section where learners can practice what they have learned. This will help reinforce the concepts and make the learning more effective. 

6. **Lack of case-studies**: As a field epidemiologist, I would find it helpful to see case-studies per disease type to identify how to translate my field experience into practice.

    - **Suggestion**: Include case studies that demonstrate how the concepts and techniques taught in the tutorial can be applied in real-world situations. 

Overall, while the tutorial is quite detailed and comprehensive, it could be improved by providing more context, breaking down complex code snippets, explaining technical terms, and including exercises and case studies.
