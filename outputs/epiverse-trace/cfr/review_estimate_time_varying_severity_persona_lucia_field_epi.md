- The vignette is well-structured and provides a clear step-by-step guide on how to estimate disease severity over the course of an outbreak using the `cfr` package in R. This is useful for Lucia as she is looking to learn how to interpret the statistical and mathematical outputs generated by infectious disease modelling R packages.

- The use of alerts to highlight important information is helpful. However, the use of technical terms and complex mathematical formulas might be challenging for Lucia, who is not an expert R user. A more detailed explanation or a glossary of terms might be beneficial.

- The vignette provides a practical example using Covid-19 data from the UK, which is beneficial for Lucia as she needs case-studies per disease type to translate her field experience into practice.

- The vignette includes code for data cleaning, plotting, and reporting using packages like `{tidyverse}`, `{ggplot2}`, and `{rmarkdown}`, which Lucia is familiar with. This is useful as it allows her to see how these packages can be used in a real-world scenario.

- The vignette could be improved by providing more context or background information on the `cfr` package and its functions. This would help Lucia understand the purpose and functionality of the package better.

- The vignette could also benefit from a summary or conclusion section that recaps the main points and findings. This would help Lucia consolidate her understanding and apply the knowledge in her work.

- The vignette could also provide more guidance on how to interpret the results and what they mean in a real-world context. This would help Lucia in her role as a Field Epidemiologist, where she needs to inform stakeholders and the general public.

- The vignette could be improved by providing more interactive elements, such as exercises or quizzes. This would help Lucia reinforce her understanding and apply the knowledge in a practical way.

- The vignette could also benefit from a section on troubleshooting or common errors. This would be beneficial for Lucia, who is not an expert R user and might encounter issues when using the package.
