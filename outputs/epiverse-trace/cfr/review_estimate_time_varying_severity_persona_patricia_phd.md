- The vignette is well-structured and provides a comprehensive guide on how to estimate disease severity over the course of an outbreak. The use of alerts to highlight important information is very helpful. However, as Patricia, I find the use of technical terms and complex mathematical formulas intimidating. It would be helpful to have more layman explanations or visual aids to understand these concepts.

- The vignette provides a clear use case and explains what data is needed. This is useful as it gives me a practical understanding of how and when to use the `cfr_time_varying()` function. 

- The vignette does a good job of explaining the reasons for changing disease severity. This is useful as it provides context and helps me understand the factors that might influence the results of my analysis.

- The code chunks are well-commented which makes it easier to follow along. However, as a beginner in R, I find some of the code difficult to understand, especially the use of functions like `map()`, `nest()`, and `unnest()`. It would be helpful to have more explanations or references to resources where I can learn more about these functions.

- The vignette provides a detailed walkthrough of how to prepare the raw data and estimate the naive and corrected CFR. This is very useful as it gives me a step-by-step guide on how to perform the analysis. However, I find the use of the `burn_in` and `smoothing_window` parameters confusing. It would be helpful to have more explanations or examples to understand how to choose the appropriate values for these parameters.

- The vignette does not provide any explanation or interpretation of the results. It would be helpful to have some guidance on how to interpret the output of the `cfr_time_varying()` function and the resulting plots.

- The vignette provides references to external resources, which is useful for further reading. However, it would be helpful to have these references hyperlinked for easier access.

Suggestions for improvements:

- Provide more layman explanations or visual aids to understand the technical terms and complex mathematical formulas.
- Provide more explanations or references to resources where beginners can learn more about functions like `map()`, `nest()`, and `unnest()`.
- Provide more explanations or examples to understand how to choose the appropriate values for the `burn_in` and `smoothing_window` parameters.
- Provide guidance on how to interpret the output of the `cfr_time_varying()` function and the resulting plots.
- Hyperlink the references for easier access.
