**Review:**

The tutorial is well-structured and provides a clear step-by-step guide on how to estimate disease severity over the course of an outbreak using R. The use of alerts to highlight important information is helpful. The tutorial also provides a good balance between theory and practical application, which is beneficial for learners like Patricia who need to translate theory into practice.

**Suggestions for improvement:**

1. **Clarify jargon and complex terms:** As a learner, Patricia may not be familiar with all the terms used in the tutorial. For example, terms like "case fatality risk (CFR)", "onset-to-death distribution", and "maximum likelihood estimation" could be explained in more detail or linked to external resources for further reading.

2. **Provide more context on the data used:** The tutorial could provide more context about the data used in the examples. For example, it could explain where the data comes from, how it was collected, and any limitations or biases in the data.

3. **Include more comments in the code:** While the tutorial does a good job of explaining what each block of code does, it could include more comments within the code itself. This would help learners like Patricia understand what each line of code is doing, especially if they are new to R.

4. **Include exercises or challenges:** The tutorial could include exercises or challenges at the end of each section to help learners practice what they have learned. This would also provide an opportunity for learners to apply the concepts to different datasets or scenarios.

5. **Provide guidance on troubleshooting:** The tutorial could include a section on common errors or issues that learners might encounter when running the code, and how to troubleshoot these issues. This would be particularly helpful for learners who are new to R and may not be familiar with how to debug code.

6. **Explain the visualizations:** While the tutorial does not include visualizations in the R markdown, it would be helpful to explain what the visualizations show and how to interpret them. This would help learners understand the results of their analysis.
