- The vignette is well-structured and provides a clear step-by-step guide to estimating disease severity over time. The use of alerts to highlight important points is helpful and the use of R Markdown makes the content easy to follow. However, as a professor who is new to R, I find the code chunks somewhat intimidating. It would be helpful to have more detailed explanations of what each line of code does, especially for complex functions and those involving data manipulation.

- The use of a real-world example (Covid-19 pandemic in the UK) is very useful for understanding the application of the methods. However, the data used in the example is not clearly described. It would be helpful to have more information about the source of the data, how it was collected, and any limitations or biases it might have.

- The use of technical terms and jargon (e.g., "burn_in", "smoothing_window", "delay_density") can be confusing for someone who is not familiar with these concepts. It would be helpful to have a glossary or definitions of these terms within the text.

- The section on "Potential reasons for changing disease severity" is informative and relevant to my research. However, it would be helpful to have more detailed explanations and examples for each point.

- The use of references is good, but it would be helpful to have more direct links to the referenced papers for easy access.

Suggestions for improvements:

- Provide more detailed explanations of the code, especially for complex functions and data manipulation steps.
- Include more information about the data used in the examples, including its source, how it was collected, and any limitations or biases.
- Include a glossary or definitions of technical terms and jargon within the text.
- Provide more detailed explanations and examples in the section on "Potential reasons for changing disease severity".
- Include direct links to the referenced papers for easy access.
