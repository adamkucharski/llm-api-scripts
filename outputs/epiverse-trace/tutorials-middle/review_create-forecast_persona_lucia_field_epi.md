**Positive Feedback:**

1. The tutorial is well-structured and follows a logical progression, which makes it easier to follow.
2. The use of real-world examples and datasets (COVID-19 and Ebola) makes the tutorial more relatable and practical.
3. The inclusion of questions, objectives, prerequisites, and key points at the beginning and end of the tutorial respectively, helps to guide the learning process.
4. The tutorial provides a good balance between theory and practice, with clear explanations and practical coding examples.
5. The use of callouts to highlight important information or provide additional context is very helpful.

**Constructive Feedback:**

1. The tutorial assumes a certain level of familiarity with R and statistical concepts, which might be challenging for beginners. It would be helpful to provide more explanations or links to resources for beginners.
2. The code chunks are quite complex and could be broken down into smaller parts with more explanations.
3. The tutorial could benefit from more visualizations to illustrate the concepts and results.
4. The challenge section could provide more guidance or hints to help learners complete the task.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. Provide more explanations or links to resources for beginners to learn R and statistical concepts.
2. Break down complex code chunks into smaller parts with more explanations.
3. Include more visualizations to illustrate the concepts and results.
4. Provide more guidance or hints in the challenge section to help learners complete the task.
5. Include a glossary of terms or a list of R packages used in the tutorial for quick reference.
