## Review

- The tutorial is well-structured and provides a step-by-step guide on how to create short-term forecasts using the `EpiNow2` package in R. This is useful for Lucia as she is looking to learn how to interpret the statistical and mathematical outputs generated by infectious disease modelling R packages.

- The tutorial assumes a certain level of familiarity with R and statistical concepts, which Lucia has. However, the tutorial could benefit from more explanations or refreshers of applied statistics and mathematics concepts, as Lucia has expressed a need for this.

- The tutorial does not provide enough context or explanation for some of the code snippets. For example, it is not clear why certain functions are used or what the parameters mean. This could be confusing for Lucia, who is not an expert R user.

- The tutorial includes a challenge section, which is a good way for Lucia to apply what she has learned. However, the challenge could be improved by providing more guidance or hints.

## Suggestions

- Provide more explanations or refreshers of applied statistics and mathematics concepts. This would help Lucia understand the underlying concepts and make the tutorial more accessible to learners with varying levels of statistical knowledge.

- Provide more context or explanation for the code snippets. This would help Lucia understand why certain functions are used and what the parameters mean.

- Include more guidance or hints in the challenge section. This would help Lucia apply what she has learned and gain more confidence in her R skills.

- Consider including case-studies per disease type. This would help Lucia translate her field experience into practice, which she has expressed a need for.

- Consider providing the tutorial in a format that allows Lucia to learn at her own pace, as she has limited time to dedicate to learning R. This could be in the form of a self-paced online course or a series of short videos.
