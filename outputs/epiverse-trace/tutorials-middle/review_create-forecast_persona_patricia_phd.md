Review:

- The tutorial is well-structured and provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the `EpiNow2` package for outbreak analysis. It is useful for learners like Patricia who are interested in infectious disease epidemiology and want to learn how to use R for data analysis.

- The tutorial provides clear objectives and prerequisites which help Patricia understand what she will learn and what knowledge she should have before starting the tutorial.

- The use of R code chunks with explanations is helpful for Patricia to understand how to use the functions in the `EpiNow2` package. However, as Patricia is not familiar with the terminal window and has never used commands to perform a particular task on her computer, she might find it difficult to understand some of the code chunks.

- The tutorial provides a challenge at the end which is a good way for Patricia to apply what she has learned. However, the challenge might be a bit difficult for her as it requires knowledge of the `epinow()` function which is not explained in detail in the tutorial.

Suggestions for improvements:

- Provide more explanations on how to use the functions in the `EpiNow2` package. This will help learners like Patricia who are not familiar with using commands to understand how to use the functions.

- Include more examples and exercises throughout the tutorial. This will give Patricia more opportunities to practice what she has learned and reinforce her understanding of the concepts.

- Provide more guidance and support for the challenge at the end of the tutorial. This could include providing hints or step-by-step instructions on how to complete the challenge.

- Consider providing additional resources or references for learners who want to learn more about the topics covered in the tutorial. This could include links to relevant articles, books, or online courses.
