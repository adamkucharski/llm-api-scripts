As Vania, I find the tutorial generally useful and relevant to my research. However, there are several areas that could be improved to make it more accessible and effective for learners like me.

1. **Prerequisites:** The prerequisites section is helpful, but it could be more detailed. For instance, it would be beneficial to provide links to resources where learners can familiarize themselves with the mentioned concepts. As someone who is self-taught in R and struggles with programming jargon, having these resources would be very helpful.

2. **Code Explanation:** The tutorial jumps into the code without much explanation. For someone like me who is not very confident in her programming skills, this can be intimidating. It would be helpful to have a brief explanation of what each line of code does, especially for complex functions like `epinow()`.

3. **Jargon:** The tutorial uses a lot of technical terms and jargon without explaining them. For example, terms like "observation process", "delay distribution", and "Gamma distribution" are used without any explanation. This can be confusing for learners who are not familiar with these terms.

4. **Visualizations:** Although the tutorial mentions that visualizations will be included, it would be helpful to have some examples or descriptions of what these visualizations will look like. This would help learners understand what they are trying to achieve with the code.

5. **Challenges:** The challenges are a great way to test understanding, but they could be more detailed. For example, the Ebola challenge could provide more guidance on how to approach the problem, especially for learners who are less confident in their programming skills.

6. **Context:** The tutorial could provide more context about why certain steps are being taken. For example, why are we assuming that the reproduction number will remain the same in the future? Why are we accounting for incomplete observations? This would help learners understand not just how to do the analysis, but why they are doing it.

Suggestions for improvements:

- Provide links to resources in the prerequisites section.
- Include more detailed explanations of the code.
- Define technical terms and jargon when they are first used.
- Include examples or descriptions of the visualizations.
- Provide more guidance in the challenges.
- Include more context about why certain steps are being taken.
