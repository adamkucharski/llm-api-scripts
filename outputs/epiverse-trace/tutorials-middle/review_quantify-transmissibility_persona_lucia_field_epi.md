## Review

- The tutorial is well-structured and provides a good introduction to the `EpiNow2` package and its use for outbreak analysis. However, it assumes a high level of familiarity with R and statistical concepts, which could be challenging for Lucia, who is not an expert R user and needs refreshers on applied statistics and mathematics concepts.

- The tutorial does a good job of explaining the concepts of delay distributions, incubation periods, and reporting delays. However, the use of statistical terms and concepts such as Bayesian inference, log normal distribution, and MCMC methods could be confusing for Lucia. It would be helpful to provide more explanations or resources for these concepts.

- The tutorial provides clear instructions on how to use the `EpiNow2` package to estimate transmission metrics and quantify geographical heterogeneity. However, Lucia might find it difficult to understand the code and its outputs without more explanations and interpretations.

- The tutorial includes several exercises and examples, which are useful for learning. However, Lucia might need more time to understand and complete these exercises due to her limited time for learning outside of work.

## Suggestions

- Provide more explanations or resources for statistical concepts such as Bayesian inference, log normal distribution, and MCMC methods. This would help Lucia understand these concepts and how they are used in outbreak analysis.

- Include more explanations and interpretations of the code and its outputs. This would help Lucia understand what the code is doing and what the outputs mean.

- Break down the exercises and examples into smaller steps and provide more guidance. This would make it easier for Lucia to follow along and learn at her own pace.

- Consider providing the tutorial in a format that allows for self-paced learning, such as an interactive online course or a series of short videos. This would allow Lucia to learn at her own pace and fit the learning into her busy schedule.
