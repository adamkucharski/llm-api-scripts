**Positive Feedback:**

- The tutorial is well-structured and provides a comprehensive guide on how to estimate key transmission metrics from a time series of case data using the R package `EpiNow2`.
- The use of questions, objectives, and prerequisites at the beginning of the tutorial helps to set the context and expectations for the learner.
- The tutorial provides clear explanations of key concepts such as the Effective Reproduction Number, Bayesian inference, and delay distributions.
- The use of callouts to highlight important information or provide additional context is very helpful.
- The step-by-step code snippets, along with their explanations, make it easier to follow the tutorial and understand the process.
- The use of visualizations to illustrate the results is a great way to enhance understanding.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

- The tutorial could benefit from a brief introduction to the `EpiNow2` package and its main functionalities.
- The prerequisites section could be expanded to include specific R packages and functions that will be used in the tutorial.
- The tutorial could include more explanations or resources for understanding the statistical and mathematical concepts used, such as Bayesian analysis and probability distributions.
- The tutorial could provide more context or examples for when and why one might want to estimate transmission metrics from case data.
- The tutorial could include more guidance on how to interpret the results and what they might mean in a real-world context.
- The tutorial could provide more information on how to handle potential issues or errors that might arise when using the `EpiNow2` package.
- The tutorial could include a summary or conclusion section at the end to reinforce the key points and takeaways.
