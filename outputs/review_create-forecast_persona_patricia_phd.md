1. The tutorial is well-structured and provides a comprehensive guide on how to create short-term forecasts from case data and account for incomplete reporting in forecasts. However, as Patricia, I find the tutorial a bit overwhelming due to the extensive use of technical terms and complex R functions. It would be helpful if the tutorial could provide more explanations or examples for each step, especially for the parts where complex functions are used.

2. The tutorial does a good job in explaining the purpose of each step and the expected outcome. This is useful for me as a learner because it helps me understand the logic behind each step and what I should expect to see. However, the tutorial could provide more context or background information about the data and the problem we are trying to solve. For example, it would be helpful to know more about the data we are using, such as where it comes from, what it represents, and why it is important for our analysis.

3. The tutorial includes a lot of code, which can be intimidating for someone like me who is still learning R. While I appreciate the detailed instructions and explanations, I find it difficult to follow along and understand what each line of code does. It would be helpful if the tutorial could break down the code into smaller chunks and explain each part in more detail. Additionally, the tutorial could provide more guidance on how to interpret the output of each function.

4. The tutorial includes several exercises and challenges, which I find very useful for reinforcing what I have learned. However, the instructions for the exercises are not always clear, and I often find myself struggling to understand what I am supposed to do. It would be helpful if the tutorial could provide more detailed instructions for the exercises, as well as solutions or examples for reference.

5. Overall, I think the tutorial could be improved by providing more context and explanations, breaking down the code into smaller chunks, and providing more detailed instructions for the exercises. As a learner, I would also appreciate more opportunities for hands-on practice and feedback. For example, the tutorial could include more exercises or quizzes throughout the tutorial, and provide immediate feedback or solutions for each exercise.
