1. As Vania, I find the tutorial useful in providing a step-by-step guide on how to create short-term forecasts from case data and account for incomplete reporting in forecasts. However, the tutorial assumes a certain level of familiarity with R and the EpiNow2 package, which can be challenging for someone like me who is still learning R and has never taken a programming course. The use of jargon and technical terms, such as "wrapper", "observation process", and "gamma distribution", can be intimidating and confusing.

2. The tutorial provides a good balance of theory and practice, with explanations of concepts followed by code snippets to illustrate their application. However, the explanations could be more detailed and beginner-friendly. For example, the tutorial could explain what a "wrapper" is and why the `epinow()` function is considered one. It could also provide more context on why we need to account for incomplete reporting in forecasts and how the observation model helps us do that.

3. The tutorial includes several exercises and challenges, which I appreciate as they provide opportunities for hands-on learning. However, the instructions for the challenges could be clearer. For example, in the Ebola outbreak analysis challenge, it's not immediately clear what the "parameter values for the delay distribution(s) and generation time distribution" refer to. More guidance on how to approach the challenges would be helpful.

4. The tutorial could benefit from more visual aids. While it's understood that visualizations will be included in the actual tutorial, it would be helpful to see examples of what these visualizations might look like. This would not only make the tutorial more engaging but also help learners like me better understand the concepts being discussed.

5. In terms of improvements, the tutorial could include a glossary of terms to help demystify the jargon. It could also provide more context and explanations for the concepts being discussed, and more guidance on how to approach the exercises and challenges. Finally, it could include more visual aids to enhance understanding and engagement.
