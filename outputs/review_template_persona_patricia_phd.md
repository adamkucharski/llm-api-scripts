1. The tutorial is useful in terms of providing practical exercises that allow Patricia to apply her theoretical knowledge in R. However, the tutorial lacks clear objectives and questions that it aims to address. This makes it difficult for Patricia to understand what she is expected to learn from the tutorial. It would be helpful if the tutorial could clearly state the objectives and questions at the beginning. This would provide a roadmap for Patricia and help her understand the purpose of the exercises.

2. The tutorial does not provide enough context or explanation for the code. For example, the tutorial asks Patricia to load contact and population data from socialmixr::polymod, but it does not explain what this data is or why it is important. This could be confusing for Patricia, especially since she is new to this field. It would be helpful if the tutorial could provide more background information and explain the significance of the tasks.

3. The tutorial does not provide enough guidance on how to complete the challenges. For example, in Challenge 2, the tutorial asks Patricia to load contact and population data for Poland using specific age bins, but it does not provide any instructions on how to do this. This could be frustrating for Patricia, especially since she is still learning how to use R. It would be helpful if the tutorial could provide step-by-step instructions or hints to guide Patricia through the challenges.

4. The tutorial does not provide any feedback or solutions for the challenges. This makes it difficult for Patricia to know if she is on the right track or if she has made a mistake. It would be helpful if the tutorial could provide solutions or examples of correct answers for the challenges. This would allow Patricia to check her work and learn from her mistakes.

5. The tutorial does not make use of visualizations, which could be a powerful tool for helping Patricia understand the data and the results of her code. It would be helpful if the tutorial could include visualizations, such as graphs or charts, to illustrate the data and the results of the exercises. This would not only make the tutorial more engaging, but also help Patricia understand the concepts better.
