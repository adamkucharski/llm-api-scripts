1. The tutorial lacks a clear structure and detailed information about the lesson. As a professor, I find it important to have a well-structured lesson plan with clear objectives and key points. This tutorial does not provide a clear list of questions that will be covered, nor does it provide a detailed list of objectives. The introduction is also missing, which makes it difficult for me to understand what the lesson is about. I would suggest adding these elements to the tutorial to make it more comprehensive and easy to follow.

2. The tutorial does not provide enough context or explanation for the code. As someone who is self-taught in R and still learning, I find it difficult to understand what the code is doing without any explanation or context. I would suggest adding comments to the code or providing a detailed explanation of what each line of code is doing. This would make it easier for me to understand and learn from the tutorial.

3. The tutorial does not provide any guidance on how to use the tools mentioned, such as Git and R Markdown. As someone who is not familiar with these tools, I find it challenging to follow along with the tutorial without any guidance. I would suggest adding a section on how to use these tools, or providing links to resources where I can learn more about them.

4. The tutorial does not provide any exercises or challenges for me to practice what I have learned. As a learner, I find it helpful to have exercises or challenges to reinforce what I have learned. I would suggest adding exercises or challenges at the end of each section to make the tutorial more interactive and engaging.

5. The tutorial does not provide any solutions or answers to the challenges. As a learner, I find it frustrating when I am unable to check my answers or understand where I went wrong. I would suggest adding solutions or answers to the challenges to help me understand the concepts better.
