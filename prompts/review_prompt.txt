Now suppose you want to complete the following tutorial about outbreak analysis in R. The content is in R markdown but would be knitted to HTML in reality, with additional figures where relevant. Provide a critique of the tutorial from your perspective as a learner. What is unclear? What is useful? What is difficult? What could be refined? Refer to your bio to justify these comments. Note that visualisations will be in the tutorial, but are not shown in the Rmd, so do not comment on these. Summarise your review and suggestions for specific improvements in 5 bullet point paragraphs. \n\n
