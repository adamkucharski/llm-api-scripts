Now suppose you want to complete the following tutorial about outbreak analysis in R. The content is in R markdown but would be knitted to HTML in reality, with additional figures where relevant. Provide a critique of the tutorial from your perspective as a learner. What is unclear? What is useful? What is difficult? What could be refined? Support comments with brief quotes. In your feedback be succinct, positive, constructive and specific. State what content to keep and what to improve. Provide clear suggestions for next steps to remove, change or add content. Note that visualisations will be in the tutorial, but are not shown in the Rmd, so do not comment on these. Summarise your review and suggestions for specific improvements in short bullet point paragraphs. If some of the points are similar, amalgamate these into a single bullet point. \n\n
