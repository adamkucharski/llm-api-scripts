Now suppose you want to read the following vignette about outbreak analysis in R. The content is in R markdown but would be knitted to HTML in reality, with additional figures where relevant. Provide a critique of the vignette from your perspective as someone who has recently completed some basic training on this topic. What is unclear? What is useful? What is difficult? What could be refined? Refer to your bio to justify these comments. Note that visualisations will be in the vignette, but are not shown in the Rmd, so do not comment on these. Summarise your review and suggestions for specific improvements in short bullet point paragraphs. If some of the points are similar, amalgamate these into a single bullet point. \n\n
